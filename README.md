# BiBL
This is the repo for BiBL (Bidirectional Bayesian Learning).

## Best Model Checkpoints

Urls for best model checkpoints are not available during the review period due to the anonymity regulations.
The model checkpoints will be released right after we cleaned up all our available checkpoints.

## Instructions for Reproducing

We recommend using conda for dependency control.

### Create conda ENV
```shell script
conda create -n BIBL python=3.6
conda activate BIBL
```

### Install spring-amr for general seq2seq formulation
```shell script
cd BiBL
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Preparing datasets
Download AMR2.0 and AMR3.0 dataset from LDC for training.
Place them right under the project folders and rename AMR2.0 dataset folder into amr2.0. (Keep the inner structure unchanged.)

### Training
```shell script
nohup ./sh/train_amr.sh & # lambda_g=0 + lambda_r=0 Text2AMR
nohup ./sh/train_text.sh & # lambda_g=0 + lambda_r=0 AMR2Text
nohup ./sh/train_amr-g_1-r_0_5.sh & # lambda_g=1.0 + lambda_r=0.5 Text2AMR
nohup ./sh/train_text-g_0_15-r_0_5.sh & # lambda_g=0.15 + lambda_r=0.5 AMR2Text
```
Best Checkpoints will be saved in "runs" folder.

### Inference and Evaluation
#### Generate inference results for benchmark dataset
```shell script
nohup ./predict_amr.sh & # please modify the model path and data generation path
nohup ./predict_text.sh & # please modify the model path and data generation path
```
#### Evaluation for Text2AMR

First we need to setup BLINK wiki entity linker. Please follow the instructions in https://github.com/facebookresearch/BLINK to complete the setup under BiBL project folder.

Then, blinkify the Text2AMR inference results.
```shell script
nohup ./blinkify.sh & # please modify the BLINK model path
```

Finally, to have comparable Smatch scores with previous works, we need to use https://github.com/mdtux89/amr-evaluation for Smatch metric evaluation. Follow the instructions in amr-evaluation project to conduct the evaluation based on the blinkified results.

#### Evaluation for AMR2Text

First we need to setup jamr. Please follow the instructions in https://github.com/jflanigan/jamr to complete the setup under BiBL project folder.

```shell script
nohup ./jamr_tokenize.sh & # please modify the jamr tokenizer script path
# please modify the generated inference data path & BLEU + chrF++ metrics will be generated
nohup ./eval_bleu.sh &
# please modify the generated inference data path & METEOR metrics will be generated
nohup ./eval_meteor.sh &
```
